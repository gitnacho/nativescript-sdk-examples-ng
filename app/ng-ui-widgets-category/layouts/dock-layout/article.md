The DockLayout is a layout that arranges its children at its own outer edges (top, bottom, left and right or center).
To define the docking side of a child element, use its dock property. To dock a child element to the center of the DockLayout, it must be the last child of the DockLayout and the stretchLastChild property of the DockLayout must be set to true.
