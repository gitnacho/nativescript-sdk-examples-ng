The AbsoluteLayout is the simplest layout in NativeScript. It uses absolute left-top (x/y) coordinates to position its children and the place of each of them depends on its Top, Left, Width and Height properties.
The AbsoluteLayout will not enforce any layout constraints on its elements and will not resize them at runtime when its size changes.
