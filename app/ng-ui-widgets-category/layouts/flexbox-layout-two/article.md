### Flexbox (order and shrink)

This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion.
It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children.
If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).

### Flex order

By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.
