> **Important**:  With version 6 of NativeScript the `TabView` component is deprecated. Consider using `BottomNavigation` or `Tabs` components instead as these components are providing much greater control and functionalities.

The `TabView` component provides a simple way to navigate between different views by tapping on some of the tabs or by swiping between the views.
By default the `TabView` will load the view of the first tab, however it's possible to load alternative tabs when the app starts by setting the componentâ€™s `selectedIndex` property.
